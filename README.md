# BlockChain-Codefundo

We plan to automatically create and store e-Voter Cards for all the citizens as soon as they turn 18. Using a trustable database such as the AADHAR data we'll fetch the event when someone turns 18 and generate an e-Voter Card. This Voter ID will be stored in a block to prevent manupulation.

This will cater to the following problems:
  1) Existence of Multiple Voter Cards of a single person
  2) Names being left out in Voter's List
  
Since voter cards are aadhar linked, it will lead to more secure elections, as there have been little or no cases of multiple aadhar card possession by a single person since it's biometric data based.
