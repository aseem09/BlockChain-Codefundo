# BlockChain-Codefundo

We plan to automatically create and store e-Voter Cards for all the citizens as soon as they turn 18. Using a trustable database such as the AADHAR data we'll fetch the event when someone turns 18 and generate an e-Voter Card. This Voter ID will be stored in a block to prevent manupulation.

TODO --->  This will cater to the following problems:
  1) Existence of Multiple Voter Cards of a single person
  2) Names being left out in Voter's Lis
  
  *Since voter cards are aadhar linked ----> Aadhar linked elections ----> People verified using aadhar data -----> More secure elections*
