Voting is what gives democracy its soul. Right now we, in India, use a manual method to register as voters, wherein a person applies as being eligible to vote by submitting certain documents, which in turn are verified by a central authority and the person is issued a voter id card. Note that getting a voter id card does not necessarily mean you can vote. Since, listing out people eligible to vote in an area also involves human intervention, it might happen that some eligible voter's name gets left out and he might not get to vote. It may also happen that someone's name is visible in two constituencies. All this leads to a not so organised election, since we may have problems like selling of voter id card illegaly, if someone has two id cards etc. 

Hence in order to curb such problems we plan to automatically create and store e-Voter Cards for all the citizens as soon as they turn 18. Using a trustable database such as the AADHAR data we'll fetch the event when someone turns 18 and generate an e-Voter Card using blockchain. Since voter cards are aadhar linked, it will lead to more secure elections, as there have been little or no cases of multiple aadhar card possession by a single person since it's biometric data based. Also, this Voter ID will be stored in a block to prevent manupulation. We will automatically generate the list of eligible users in a constituency using the information in blocks.

This will cater to the following problems:
  1) Existence of Multiple Voter Cards of a single person
  2) Names being left out in Voter's List
  3) Errors due to human involvement in voter IDs generation.
